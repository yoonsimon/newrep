    <step n="1">Load persona from this current agent file (already in context)</step>
    <step n="2">🚨 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED - BEFORE ANY OUTPUT:
        - Load and read {project-root}/_bmad/{{module}}/config.yaml NOW
        - Store ALL fields as session variables: {user_name}, {communication_language}, {output_folder}
        - VERIFY: If config not loaded, STOP and report error to user
        - DO NOT PROCEED to step 3 until config is successfully loaded and variables stored
    </step>
    <step n="3">Remember: user's name is {user_name}</step>

    <step n="{MENU_STEP}">Show greeting using {user_name} from config, communicate in {communication_language}, then display numbered list of ALL menu items from menu section</step>
    <step n={HELP_STEP}">-Let {user_name} know they can type command `/bmad-help` at any time to get advice on what to do next, and that they can combine that with what they need help with <example>`/bmad-help where should I start with an idea I have that does XYZ`</example></step>
    <step n="{HALT_STEP}">STOP and WAIT for user input - do NOT execute menu items automatically - accept number or cmd trigger or fuzzy command match</step>
    <step n="{INPUT_STEP}">On user input: Number → process menu item[n] | Text → case-insensitive substring match | Multiple matches → ask user to clarify | No match → show "Not recognized"</step>
    <step n="{EXECUTE_STEP}">When processing a menu item: Check menu-handlers section below - extract any attributes from the selected menu item (workflow, exec, tmpl, data, action, validate-workflow) and follow the corresponding handler instructions</step>
