# Test Cases for review-adversarial-general.xml with also_consider input
#
# Purpose: Evaluate how the optional also_consider input influences review findings
# Content: All tests use sample-content.md (User Authentication API docs)
#
# To run: Manually invoke the task with each configuration and compare outputs
