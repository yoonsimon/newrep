title: Welcome to the BMad Method
---

The BMad Method (**B**reakthrough **M**ethod of **A**gile AI **D**riven Development) is an AI-driven development framework that helps you build software faster and smarter. It provides specialized AI agents, guided workflows, and intelligent planning that adapts to your project's complexity—whether you're fixing a bug or building an enterprise platform.

If you're comfortable working with AI coding assistants like Claude, Cursor, or GitHub Copilot, you're ready to get started.

## How to Use These Docs

These docs are organized into four sections based on what you're trying to do:

| Section           | Purpose                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tutorials**     | Learning-oriented. Step-by-step guides that walk you through building something. Start here if you're new. |
| **How-To Guides** | Task-oriented. Practical guides for solving specific problems. "How do I customize an agent?" lives here.  |
| **Explanation**   | Understanding-oriented. Deep dives into concepts and architecture. Read when you want to know *why*.       |
| **Reference**     | Information-oriented. Technical specifications for agents, workflows, and configuration.                   |

## What You'll Need

BMad works with any AI coding assistant that supports custom system prompts or project context. Popular options include:

- **[Claude Code](https://code.claude.com)** — Anthropic's CLI tool (recommended)
- **[Cursor](https://cursor.sh)** — AI-first code editor
- **[Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf)** — Codeium's AI IDE
- **[Roo Code](https://roocode.com)** — VS Code extension

You should be comfortable with basic software development concepts like version control, project structure, and agile workflows. No prior experience with BMad-style agent systems is required—that's what these docs are for.
