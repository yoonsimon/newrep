title: "Advanced Elicitation"
description: Push the LLM to rethink its work using structured reasoning methods
---

Make the LLM reconsider what it just generated. You pick a reasoning method, it applies that method to its own output, you decide whether to keep the improvements.

Dozens of methods are built in - things like First Principles, Red Team vs Blue Team, Pre-mortem Analysis, Socratic Questioning, and more.

## When to Use It

- After a workflow generates content and you want alternatives
- When output seems okay but you suspect there's more depth
- To stress-test assumptions or find weaknesses
- For high-stakes content where rethinking helps

Workflows offer advanced elicitation at decision points - after the LLM has generated something, you'll be asked if you want to run it.

## How It Works

1. LLM suggests 5 relevant methods for your content
2. You pick one (or reshuffle for different options)
3. Method is applied, improvements shown
4. Accept or discard, repeat or continue
