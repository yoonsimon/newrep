title: "Quick Flow"
description: Fast-track for small changes - skip the full methodology
---

Quick Flow is for when you don't need the full BMad Method. Skip Product Brief, PRD, and Architecture - go straight to implementation.

## How It Works

1. **Run `quick-spec`** — generates a focused tech-spec
2. **Run `quick-dev`** — implements it

That's it.

## When to Use It

- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Small features
- Prototyping

## When to Use Full BMad Method Instead

- New products
- Major features
- Multiple teams involved
- Stakeholder alignment needed
