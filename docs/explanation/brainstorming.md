## What is Brainstorming?

Run `brainstorming` and you've got a creative facilitator pulling ideas out of you - not generating them for you. The AI acts as coach and guide, using proven techniques to create conditions where your best thinking emerges.

**Good for:**

- Breaking through creative blocks
- Generating product or feature ideas
- Exploring problems from new angles
- Developing raw concepts into action plans

## How It Works

1. **Setup** - Define topic, goals, constraints
2. **Choose approach** - Pick techniques yourself, get AI recommendations, go random, or follow a progressive flow
3. **Facilitation** - Work through techniques with probing questions and collaborative coaching
4. **Organize** - Ideas grouped into themes and prioritized
5. **Action** - Top ideas get next steps and success metrics

Everything gets captured in a session document you can reference later or share with stakeholders.

:::note[Your Ideas]
Every idea comes from you. The workflow creates conditions for insight - you're the source.
