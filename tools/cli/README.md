# BMad CLI Tool

## Installing external repo BMad official modules

For external official modules to be discoverable during install, ensure an entry for the external repo is added to external-official-modules.yaml.

For community modules - this will be handled in a different way. This file is only for registration of modules under the bmad-code-org.
